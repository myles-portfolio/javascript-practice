# JavaScript Practice

JavaScript Practice is simply a collection of .js files that have some random data and an accompanying problem set that you will need to use commonly used methods to create functions that return the correct answer to the questions.

## Practice #1 - D&D Characters

Use one or more of the following methods to answer some questions about the provided D&D characters array of objects:

- .join()
- .map()
- .reduce()
- .filter()
- .includes()
- .push()
- .sort()
- for loops
- destructuring

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository, and add it to your own repo if you'd like.
- Run npm i to install dependencies and packages.
- Start solving the practice problems, following the "Instruction" section.

## Instructions

Each problem set has its own folder (i.e. "practice-1").

You'll find a list of the questions on the "questions.md" file for each practice, and you will write your functions in the "worksheet.js" file.

Don't change or remove:
 - Functions' arguments or their names.
 - Lines of code that are asked NOT to change or delete.
 - The checkAnswers function for each question.
 - The "data" or "answers" files.

 To check your answers as you complete each question, simply open your terminal and enter:

 ```
 $ node worksheet.js
 ```
You'll see 'Correct!' once you have returned the correct answer in your function. Good luck!

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue and ask.

## Contributing

This project was originally created to support my own progression towards mastering JavaScript concepts like arrow functions, applicatives, method chaining, etc. But I figured others may want to easy practice as well without creating there own practice problems.

If you would like to contribute additional practice problem sets, pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to add/improve/change.

I have a larger project planned for the future that is derived from this mini-project. If you are curious about it, or potentially interested in contributing, let me know. You can reach me on Discord at lemonyslash#4831.
